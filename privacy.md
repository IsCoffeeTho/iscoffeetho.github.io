This Privacy Policy describes how information is handled when you visit iscoffeetho.github.io (the “Site”).

## 1. Overview

The Site is a static website hosted using GitHub Pages. It does not require user accounts and does not intentionally collect personal information.

## 2. Information Collected Automatically

While the Site itself does not collect personal data, GitHub, as the hosting provider, may automatically collect certain technical information when you visit
the Site, including:

- IP address
- Browser type and version
- Operating system
- Referring pages
- Date and time of access

This data is processed by GitHub in accordance with their own privacy policy and is not directly accessible or controlled by the Site owner.

GitHub’s privacy policy can be found at:  
[https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)

## 3. Cookies

The Site itself does not set or use cookies.

However, GitHub Pages may use cookies or similar technologies as part of their platform infrastructure. Any such usage is governed by GitHub’s policies.

## 4. Analytics

The Site does not use custom analytics tools (such as Google Analytics, Plausible, or similar) at this time.

## 5. Third-Party Content and Links

The Site may contain links to third-party websites (such as GitHub repositories or external documentation). This Privacy Policy does not apply to those sites,
and you are encouraged to review their respective privacy policies.

## 6. Data Security

Because the Site does not collect or store personal data, there is no user data stored by the Site owner. GitHub is responsible for the security of the hosting
infrastructure.

## 7. Children’s Information

The Site is not directed at children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes to the Site or hosting environment. Any updates will be posted on this page with a
revised “Last updated” date.
