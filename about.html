	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
		I’m a <span class="accent">software engineer</span> with a strong focus on building developer tooling, backend frameworks, and systems-level software.
		I’m particularly interested in how <span class="accent">low-level design</span> decisions affect ergonomics, performance, and long-term maintainability,
		and I enjoy working on projects that sit at the boundary between <span class="accent">infrastructure and developer</span> experience.
	</p>
	<p>
		A large part of my work revolves around modern <span class="accent">JavaScript</span> and <span class="accent">TypeScript</span> runtimes, especially
		Bun. I maintain and experiment with several projects in this space, including HTTP frameworks, templating tools, and native bindings. Through this work,
		I’ve gained hands-on experience designing <span class="accent">APIs</span>, implementing routing and middleware systems, and thinking carefully about
		how developers interact with libraries at <span class="accent">scale</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Alongside web and tooling work, I spend time exploring systems programming concepts such as <span class="accent">compiler</span> construction, native
		interop, and low-level libraries. I invest in doing <span class="accent">hobby projects</span> while I have down time to increase my ability for when I
		am in a production environment.
	</p>
	<p>
		I <span class="accent">value</span> clarity, explicitness, and pragmatism in software design. I prefer simple,
		<span class="accent">well-documented</span> systems over clever abstractions, and I aim to build tools that are easy to reason about, <span class="accent">easy to extend</span>,
		and hard to misuse. Whether I’m working on a framework, a programming experiment, or a small utility, my <span class="accent">goal</span> is to create software that other developers
		can confidently <span class="accent">build on</span> and consumers to <span class="accent">intuitively</span> use.
